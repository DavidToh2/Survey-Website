# Random survey website

### Frameworks: Flask, SASS, JQuery

Survey and site data is fetched from locally hosted .json files by the server, then passed to JINJA2 to be rendered via HTML. 

CSS Cards and Slideshows: manipulated by Javascript functions that show and hide specific cards in order, while preserving display cohesion.

### Testing pipeline: Heroku 

(to implement when website is closer to completion)
